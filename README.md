# ⚽ TransferIQ  
## Dynamic Player Transfer Value Prediction using AI

TransferIQ is an end-to-end **machine learning system** that predicts the **market value of football players** by integrating **performance data, injury history, and public sentiment**.  
The goal is to make player valuation **objective, data-driven, and interpretable**, reducing reliance on subjective judgments.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Football player valuation is complex because:

- Player data is **scattered across multiple sources**
- Injury impact is often **ignored or underestimated**
- Public and media sentiment is rarely quantified
- Manual evaluation is **subjective and inconsistent**

**TransferIQ** addresses these challenges using AI and machine learning.
